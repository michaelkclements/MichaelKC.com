<h1>A video I put together</h1>

<p>Flying Fenix was my first video I created using the Unreal 3 engine (Gears of War PC to be precise) for the website <a href="http://litfusefilms.com/">LitFuseFilms.com</a> which I co-founded. The group Lit Fuse Films made machinima videos using games and my interest in the Unreal engine gave me the opportunity to create a video for my own. I went through the animations that Gears of War had and found a nice mid-roll animation which looked like he was flying. The rest was basically my weird imagination put to the test.</p>
